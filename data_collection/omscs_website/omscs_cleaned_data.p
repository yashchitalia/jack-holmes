S' This course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. \\u201cScale\\u201d really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you\\u2019ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you\\u2019ll need to do so. \\xa0 The techniques you\\u2019ll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and manycore shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques you\\u2019ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice. (Programming models you\\u2019ll use include Cilk Plus, OpenMP, and MPI, and possibly others.)'

S' Data science plays an important role in many industries. In facing massive amount of heterogeneous data, scalable machine learning and data mining algorithms and systems become extremely important for data scientists. The growth of volume, complexity and speed in data drives the need for scalable data analytic algorithms and systems. In this course, we study such algorithms and systems in the context of healthcare applications. \\xa0 In healthcare, large amounts of heterogeneous medical data have become available in various healthcare organizations (payers, providers, pharmaceuticals). Those data could be an enabling resource for deriving insights for improving care delivery and reducing waste. The enormity and complexity of these datasets present great challenges in analyses and subsequent applications to a practical clinical environment. In this course, we introduce the characteristics of medical data and associated data mining challenges on dealing with such data. We cover various algorithms and systems for big data analytics. We focus on studying those big data techniques in the context of concrete healthcare analytic applications such as predictive modeling, computational phenotyping and patient similarity. \\xa0 <p>We focus on studying those big data techniques in the context of concrete healthcare analytic applications such as: 1. Predictive modeling: e.g., how to predict disease risks on individual patients? 2. Computational phenotyping: e.g., how to convert patient data from electronic health records into meaningful clinical concepts (phenotypes)? 3. Patient similarity: e.g., how to measure similarity between patients within a specific context? \\xa0</p> We also study big data analytic technology: 1.

S' In the 21st century, embedded systems are the systems of future with cellular phones, smart-phones, tablets becoming the dominant platforms for computing and communication. The ubiquity of information and the associated need for the computation that accompanies it is driving this revolution only to be accelerated by the new paradigms such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT). These platforms are clearly very different in terms of their processing requirements which are very unique: real-time needs, high performance but at low energy, compact-code and data segments, and most importantly ever changing software stack. Such unique requirements have led to a complete redesign and reinvention of the both hardware and the software stack from ground up, for example, brand new processors such as ARM, DSPs, network processors were invented all the way up to new virtual machines such as Dalvik, new operating systems such as Android and new programming models and compiler optimizations. The goal of this course is to take a holistic view of the embedded system stack with a focus on processor architectures, instruction sets and the associated advanced compiler optimizations that take advantage of the same. Following are the segments that will be covered in the course: Part I: Embedded Processor Architectures 1. Introduction to instruction level parallelism: Pipelining, RISC vs CISC, Very Large Instruction Words (VLIW) instruction sets, Hardware complexity (Superscalars) vs Compiler Optimizations (VLIWs) Tradeoffs 2. Design of Instruction Set Architectures: VLIW encoding, Exposing vs Hiding Architectural Details, RISC vs CISC ISAs, Opportunities for compilers, Dependences and Independences, Instruction bundling for VLIW, Compact instruction representation. 3. Embedded Micro-architectures: Scratch-pad: software managed memory,clustered register files, special arithmetic, addressing modes for special needs (DSPs), branches in embedded domains: speculation and predication, unbundling branches Part II: Software Optimizations 4. Introduction to Compiler phases: Overall working of the compiler, overview of phases, intermediate representation, backend code generation issues 5. Register Allocation Foundation: RISC philosophy (load, store architecture), Live range analysis, Interference Graph, Graph Coloring Based Register Allocation, Live Range Splitting 6. Register Allocation for Embedded Processors: Post-pass register allocation, Allocation gaps and register reuse, Energy reduction due to reduced memory accesses, Differential register allocation, Register encoding, Hardware support, Increase in exposed registers, Software pipelining and energy reduction 7. Data Layouts for Embedded Processors: Auto addressing mode, Data layouts, Simple and general offset assignment problems, Address sequence optimizations, Memory coalescing, Data and code segment minimization 8. Data and Code Compaction: X-Y memory, Parallelizing Load/Stores in DSPs, Data replication, Performance vs Data Segment/ size, ARM vs Thumb code generation, Mixed code generation, Frequent values in embedded programs and their encoding, Data cache optimization via compaction. 9. Network Processors: Processing in the network, Network processors, Dual Bank Register Allocation for Network Processors, Multi-threading in network processors, Context switch and latency, Register allocation across threads to minimize latency'

We\\u2019ll develop basic methods for applications that include finding known models in images, depth recovery from stereo, camera calibration, image stabilization, automated alignment (e.g. panoramas), tracking, and action recognition. The focus of the course is to develop the intuitions and mathematics of the methods in lecture, and then to learn about the difference between theory and practice in the problem sets. All algorithms work perfectly in the slides. But remember what Yogi Berra said: In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is. (Einstein said something similar but who knows more about real life?) In general we will not make use of image and vision libraries until first understanding (and often coding) the basic methods.

All the database concepts, techniques and tools that are needed to develop a database application from scratch are introduced along the way when they are needed. In parallel - slightly delayed - learners in the course will apply the database application development methodology, the techniques, and the tools to their own major class team project. In addition to the development methodology, techniques and tools learned in this course will include the Extended Entity Relationship Model, the Relational Model, Relational algebra, calculus and SQL, database normalization, efficiency and indexing. Finally, techniques and tools for metadata management and archival will be presented.'
