Charles Isbell,Georgia Institute of Technology,3.5,4.3,4.3,4.3,new-hot,http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=962024,"My favorite professor so far. He really knows his stuff, and explains it to students in an easy to understand way. He has an amazing sense of humor and if I had to sum his personality in one word it would be awesome. His classes are really fun to go to and informative as well. He has Udacity lectures online but the classroom is way better."Tucker Balch,Georgia Institute of Technology,5,2,2,2,new-hot,http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1939465,"I am just taking his CS 6446 ML4T class. He is a great professor. He is not condescending at all. He is very humble, which I think is a great attribute. So you do not feel intimidated. I wish he offered more classes!"Leo Mark,Georgia Institute of Technology,4,3,3,3,new-hot,http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1422812,"His courses are plentiful and satisfying, some might say ""juciful.""  At first, the course load may seem insurmountable, but the professor wants everyone to digest as much as possible.  Although by the end you feel overwhelmed, you keep coming back for more."Nick Feamster,Georgia Institute of Technology,5,2,2,2,new-hot,http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1840312,GOOD PROFESSOR!Santosh Pande,Georgia Institute of Technology,5,4,4,4,new-hot,http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1667862,"Brilliant Professor, the course material is so extensive that if taken seriously the student will be ready to take up any compiler related work in the industry."Thad Starner,Georgia Institute of Technology,3.9,3.8,3.8,3.8,cold,http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=10478,"Class is interesting and Thad is good guy.  He will you out.  All the projects are in LISP and are very time consuming.  If you aren't experienced in LISP, you sure will be.  Tests are long and difficult but open book ote.  You will have a rock-solid grasp on the fundamentals of AI after this course."Aaron Bobick,Georgia Institute of Technology,3.7,3,3,3,cold,http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=540063,"Not bad for a tough class, he is funny and a pretty cool teacher.  Go to the review sessions for tests and the sessions where they do your homework for you and you can make an A."Charles Isbell,Georgia Institute of Technology,3.5,4.3,4.3,4.3,new-hot,http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=962024,"My favorite professor so far.

He's very intelligent and explains everything thoroughly, and gives appropriate praise when we finish the more difficult sections."
