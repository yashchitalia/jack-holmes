aS'My favorite professor so far. He really knows his stuff, and explains it to students in an easy to understand way. He has an amazing sense of humor and if I had to sum his personality in one word it would be awesome. His classes are really fun to go to and informative as well. He has Udacity lectures online but the classroom is way better.'

Tests are long and difficult but open book ote.  You will have a rock-solid grasp on the fundamentals of AI after this course."
